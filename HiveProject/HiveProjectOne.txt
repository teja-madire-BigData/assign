1)Create a schema based on the given dataset

A) 
#Creating a database named Project

create database Project;

use Project;

#Creating a schema for Agent_Loging_Report dataset

create table Agent_Loging_Report
     (
     SL_No int,
     Agent_Name string,
     Date_Date string,
     Login_Time string,
     Logout_Time string,
     Duration string
     )
     row format delimited
     fields terminated by ',';

#Creating a schema for Agent_Performance dataset


create table Agent_Performance
     (
     SL_No int,
     Date_Date string,
     Agent_Name string,
     Total_Chats int,
     Average_Response_Time string,
     Average_Resolution_Time string,
     Average_Ratings float,
     Total_Feedback int
     )
     row format delimited
     fields terminated by ','
     tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");





2)Dump the data inside the hdfs in the given schema location.

A) 

#loading data into Agent_Loging_Report table

load data local inpath 'file:///config/workspace/AgentLogingReport.csv' into table agent_loging_report;

#loading data into Agent_Performance table

load data local inpath 'file:///config/workspace/AgentPerformance.csv' into table agent_performance;



3)List of all agents' names.

A) select distinct agent_name from agent_loging_report;


4)Find out agent average rating.

A) select agent_name,avg(average_ratings) from agent_performance group by agent_name;


5)Total working days for each agents.

A) hive> select Agent_Name,count(distinct Date_Date) from Agent_Loging_Report group by Agent_Name;



6)Total query that each agent have taken.

A) hive> select Agent_Name,sum(Total_Chats) from Agent_Performance group by Agent_name;



7)Total Feedback that each agent have received.

A) select agent_name,sum(total_feedback) from agent_performance group by agent_name; 


8)Agent name who have average rating between 3.5 to 4.

A) hive> select Agent_Name,avg(Average_Ratings) from Agent_Performance group by Agent_Name having avg(Average_Ratings) between 3.5 and 4;


9)Agent name who have rating less than 3.5.

A) hive> select DISTINCT Agent_Name,Average_Ratings from Agent_Performance where Average_Ratings<3.5; 


10)Agent name who have rating more than 4.5.

A) hive> select DISTINCT Agent_Name,Average_Ratings from Agent_Performance where Average_Ratings > 4.5;

11)How many feedback agents have received more than 4.5 average.

A)

12)average weekly response time for each agent.

A)

13)average weekly resolution time for each agents.

A)

14)Find the number of chat on which they have received a feedback.

A)

15)Total contribution hour for each and every agents weekly basis.

A)

16)Perform inner join, left join and right join based on the agent column and after joining the table export that data into your local system.

A)

17)Perform partitioning on top of the agent column and then on top of that perform bucketing for each partitioning.
